For this problem, i am meant to prompt the user to input any statement and print it in lower case 

# How the code works
This code prompts the user to input any statement in capital letters using the input function and saves it as a variable named 'word'

This statement is received as a string according to the input function

Then, the '.lower()' which is nested inside the print statement is a string method is used to convert the statement which is now called 'word' to lower case and is then printed out
